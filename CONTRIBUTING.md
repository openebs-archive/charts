## Filing an issue

### Before filing an issue

If you are unsure whether you have found a bug, please consider asking in the [Slack](https://kubernetes.slack.com/messages/openebs) first. If the behavior you are seeing is confirmed as a bug or issue, it can easily be re-raised in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/openebs/openebs/issues/new).


## Steps to Contribute

OpenEBS is an Apache 2.0 Licensed project and all your commits should be signed with Developer Certificate of Origin. See [Sign your work](#sign-your-work).

* Find an issue to work on or create a new issue. The issues are maintained at [openebs/openebs](https://github.com/openebs/openebs/issues).
* Claim your issue by commenting your intent to work on it to avoid duplication of efforts.
* Fork the repository on GitHub.
* Create a branch from where you want to base your work (usually main).
  - If you are updating helm charts, create a branch from main. 
  - If you are updating an artifact, create a branch from gh-pages.
* Commit your changes by making sure the commit messages convey the need and notes about the commit.
* Push your changes to the branch in your fork of the repository.
* Submit a pull request to the original repository. See [Pull Request checklist](#pull-request-checklist)

## Pull Request Checklist
* Rebase to the current HEAD branch before submitting your pull request.
* Commits should be as small as possible. Each commit should follow the checklist below:
  - For code changes, add tests relevant to the fixed bug or new feature.
  - Commit header (first line) should convey what changed
  - Commit body should include details such as why the changes are required and how the proposed changes help
  - DCO Signed, please refer [signing commit](#sign-your-commits)
* PR title must follow convention: `<type>(<scope>): <subject>`.

  For example:
  ```
   feat(charts): add support for OpenEBS 1.11
   ^--^ ^-----^   ^-----------------------^
     |     |         |
     |     |         +-> PR subject, summary of the changes
     |     |
     |     +-> scope of the PR, i.e. component of the project this PR is intend to update
     |
     +-> type of the PR.
  ```

    Most common types are:
    * `feat`        - for new features, not a new feature for the build script
    * `fix`         - for bug fixes or improvements, not a fix for the build script
    * `chore`       - changes not related to production code
    * `docs`        - changes related to documentation
    * `style`       - formatting, missing semicolons, linting fix, etc; no significant production code changes
    * `test`        - adding missing tests, refactoring tests; no production code change
    * `refactor`    - refactoring production code, eg. renaming a variable or function name, there should not be any significant production code changes
    * `cherry-pick` - if PR is merged in the HEAD branch and raised to release branch(like v1.9.x)

### Sign your work

We use the Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) as an additional safeguard for the OpenEBS project. This is a well established and widely used mechanism to assure contributors have confirmed their right to license their contribution under the project's license. Please read [developer-certificate-of-origin](./contribute/developer-certificate-of-origin).

Please certify it by just adding a line to every git commit message. Any PR with Commits which does not have DCO Signoff will not be accepted:

```
  Signed-off-by: Random J Developer <random@developer.example.org>
```

or use the command `git commit -s -m "commit message comes here"` to sign-off on your commits.

Use your real name (sorry, no pseudonyms or anonymous contributions). If you set your `user.name` and `user.email` git configs, you can sign your commit automatically with `git commit -s`. You can also use git [aliases](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Git-Aliases) like `git config --global alias.ci 'commit -s'`. Now you can commit with `git ci` and the commit will be signed.
